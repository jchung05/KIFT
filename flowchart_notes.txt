We need to break KIFT into different parts as follows:

	Make functions that are called for setting alarm, brightness, etc
	Create a server to house database material (XML, JSON, db, etc)
	Create a client which uses functions to detect phones (edited)
	Possibly create a website
(+)	Create a script for Mac OS X to install CMUSphinx
	Create a script for Linux to install CMUSphinx


How it works will be:

	Turn on server
	Turn on client
	User speaks into client
	Client detects phones with pocketsphinx
	Client breaks phones down into syntactic sentences and sends to server
	Server also TRAINS according to multiple attempts
	Server calls appropriate function with valid sentences

Server Functions:
	
	Set an alarm / timer
	Turn on / off lights
	Send email / SMS
	Check current events / weather / traffic
	Check clients currently connected to server
	Check user client's location
	Play some music
	Search web for ______
	Check usage history
