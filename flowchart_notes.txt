We need to break KIFT into different parts as follows:

	Organize functions to detect phones
	Make functions that are called for setting alarm, brightness, etc
	Create a server to house database material (XML, JSON, db, etc)
	Create a client which uses functions to detect phones (edited)


How it works will be:

	Turn on server
	Turn on client
	User speaks into client
	Client detects phones with pocketsphinx
	Client breaks phones down into vectors and sends to server
	Server interprets phone vectors and searches for a valid function
	Server also TRAINS according to multiple attempts
	Server calls appropriate function with valid phone vector (edited)
